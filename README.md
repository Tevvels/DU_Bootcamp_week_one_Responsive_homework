# DU_Bootcamp_week_one_Responsive_homework

Week one homework making a responsive portfolio.

This is the second homework assignment for DU's coding bootcamp

I had to create a portfolio for myself. It is something that I will be able to update as I progress further into my career as a developer and I had to use bootstrap to show that I understand the library and at least some of what it has to offer.

This website had to be screen responsive. All this means is that the website is usuable and stylish on mobile devices as much as on computers. The reason behind this is because now in our daily lives we consume the most inforation off of our phone. for some it is their only means to the internet. This allows us to still be an option.

The Website is composed of 3 different pages.

    The Index.html which is the about me section. Make sense to have that as the main page of the website. It contains my name a photo of me as well as a description about who I am as a person and developer

    The Portfolio.html has rows of photos that showcase my homework assignments and projects which can demonstrate my skills.

    The contact page is designed to be simple, A name input, Email input and small textarea. so that way my future clients or potential employer.

The website does also contain my own style.css page. I use that page to add more unique styling that I couldn't not do ( at the moment ) with Bootstrap.

I still use the same concepts in mind from the first homework assignment which is to be clean, add comments for more readability and make sure its semantic for those who need accessibility
